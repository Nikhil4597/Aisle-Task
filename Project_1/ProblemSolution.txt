Problem statement: Aisle has millions of users from over 150 countries. Each user gets 10 free daily
Likes. Unused Likes are not carried forward to the next day. We must refresh the number of daily Likes 
at 12:00 pm according to the user's local time.

How would you go about doing this in a scalable way? No need to write code, simply explain
to us in theory the backend logic in your own words.

Solution: 
	Steps for implementing this task in a scalable way.
	
	1. Utilize a database to store necessary user data, including usernames, IDs, timezones, and other identification details.
	
	2. Keep a record of each user's likes usage, including the users they've liked and the remaining likes.
	
	3. Create an automated task that manages the daily likes refresh process. This task will use stored user data to determine when and how to reset each user's free like.
	
	4. Make sure the automated task accounts for each user's local timezone. This guarantees that likes are refreshed at 12:00 pm in their respective local times.
	
	5. Include a validation step within the automation task to confirm whether any users remain for the likes refresh. This prevents unnecessary processing if all users have already had their likes reset.
